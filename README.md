## Keyboard

With the panel open: `j`/`k` or arrows move, `←`/`→` switch area tabs, `enter`
turns the highlighted device on or off, `e` expands its controls, `s` opens
settings, `r` refreshes, `esc` closes, `tab` moves to the next bar panel.

## What you can control

| Domain | Control |
|---|---|
| `light` | On/off, plus a brightness slider when the light is dimmable |
| `switch`, `fan`, `input_boolean`, `humidifier` | On/off |
| `lock` | Lock/unlock switch |
| `scene`, `script` | Activate button |
| `media_player` | Previous / play-pause / next, volume slider |
| `cover` | Open / stop / close |
| `climate` | On/off when advertised, plus a target temperature or low/high band |
| `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, everything else | State display only |

## Scripting

The panel is reachable over the shell's IPC, so a device can go on a keybind:

```bash
omarchy-shell hass toggleEntity light.desk
omarchy-shell hass activate scene.movie_night
omarchy-shell hass expand climate.hallway   # opens the panel, unfolded
omarchy-shell hass favorite light.desk      # add to / remove from the panel
omarchy-shell hass status
omarchy-shell hass settings             # connection settings
omarchy-shell hass devices              # device picker
```

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4 (`schemaVersion: 1` plugin API)
- Python 3.11 or newer
- `secret-tool` (libsecret) with a running keyring daemon

The pure-Python runtime of `websockets` 17.0.1 is bundled with the plugin and
loaded from `vendor/`. Users don't need `python-websockets`, `qt6-websockets`,
`pip`, a virtual environment, or a first-run download.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/konradk/hass.git --enable
```

For local development, symlink the checkout instead:

```bash
ln -sfn "$PWD" ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/hass
omarchy restart shell
omarchy plugin enable hass
```

## Setup

Click the gear in the panel header, or press `s` with the panel open. From a
terminal: `omarchy-shell hass settings`, or `omarchy-shell hass devices`
to open device picker.

Paste your Home Assistant URL and a long-lived access token (Home Assistant →
your profile → Security), or flip on **Demo mode** to try the panel against a
built-in fake house with no instance at all. Then switch to **Devices** and
star the ones you want in the panel.

## Debugging

```bash
omarchy-shell hass status     # what the widget sees
omarchy-shell hass toggle     # open/close the panel
omarchy plugin validate .     # check the manifest before committing
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 tests/test_bridge.py     # bridge, against a fake Home Assistant
python3 tests/test_vendor.py     # pinned dependency, license and offline import
python3 tests/test_service_contract.py
node    tests/test_connection.js # URL/origin and generation rules
node    tests/test_config.js     # config normalization and secret exclusion
node    tests/test_store.js      # state and registry projections
node    tests/test_model.js      # entity formatting and classification
node    tests/test_row_model.js  # ListModel row projection
python3 tests/test_qml_style.py  # UI house style (fonts, palette, tokens)
```

## Security

Your long-lived access token is stored in the system keyring via `secret-tool`.
Use an `https://` Home Assistant URL whenever possible. If you explicitly use
`http://`, the token is sent without transport encryption; reserve that for a
trusted local network where you understand the risk.

When the checkout is symlinked for local development, runtime settings are
written to `config.json` in the checkout. That file is ignored because it can
contain private instance URLs, area names, entity IDs, and display-name
overrides. The access token is never stored there.

## Bundled dependency maintenance
